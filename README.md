# SVMKit - ABK Labs

**Just build together** - ABK Labs believes that open-source software is the purest form of innovation. In our world, there are no competitors, only contributors.

SVMKit is built with this ethos in mind. We encourage you to fork, customize, and contribute to everything you find useful in these repositories.

SVMKit is a suite of tools designed to make building, maintaining, and operating blockchains with the Solana Virtual Machine (SVM) more accessible. With SVMKit, you have a powerful foundation whether you're a chain builder or a node operator.

## Key Features:

- **Rapid Setup for Chain Builders**: Go from genesis block to a multi-node cluster in under an hour, enabling fast deployment and network scalability.
  
- **Streamlined Operations for Node Operators**: Join any fork of Solana with a supported Validator client in under two minutes, bringing ease and efficiency to node operation.

- **Ecosystem Services**: Enjoy integrated RPC, Wallet Support, and main net contracts, giving you access to essential ecosystem services and the flexibility to work with main net providers without custom integrations.

All of these features are crafted to reduce time to market and let you focus on your core products, rather than the complexity of maintaining and operating the network.

If you have questions or want to contribute, join us in the SVM community chat on Telegram or make a pull request.

# About Us

Founded on open-source principles, ABK Labs believes the future of the internet is permissionless, open, and driven by the convergence of AI, blockchain, and token economies. With roots in the early days of open-source software, our team has built software used by millions globally—and even on Mars.

Since our founding in June, we’ve grown from three to ten team members and scaled our community from 10 to over 240 builders, including teams backed by $250 million in venture funding. We’re profitable, supporting top companies in the space and reinvesting to advance open-source tools at the intersection of Solana and AI.

Our flagship product, **SVMKit**, simplifies SVM network operation, while **Zuma**, our alternative validator, allows for modular customization without client forking. ABK Labs is driven by a community of builders, believers, and innovators committed to a decentralized future. If you share this vision, explore our repos or consider joining our team.
